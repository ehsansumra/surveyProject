# Hi. I'm Ehsan Sumra and this is my Full Stack Survey Project.

This is a fully responsive and user-friendly interface to create surveys, take surveys, and view the submission data of each survey.
This app has a REST API backend using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize ORM and MySQL. It also uses a Single page application frontend architecture using React.

I made extensive use of React Hooks and functional components to handle state and rendering components. Check out the client/src folder to see how I designed the frontend. Below are screenshots of the app in action.

### If you want to run the website, clone this repo and [follow these instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md)

### Upon creation of a survey, a link is generated for you to share with others.
